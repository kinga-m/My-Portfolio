    <h1>A little Bit About Myself</h1>
    <p>Hello there, I am Kinga Moktan, a web developer from Melbourne. I have always wanted to learn coding
        and very happy to be learning it at the <a href="https://coderacademy.edu.au/">Coder Academy</a> great and friendly teachers.
     i came to australia on october of 2014 and been loving this counrty so far. One thing
     i love about this country is that it has many cultures from different parts of 
     the world and i love being around it.
        <br></br>

        My goal as a web devloper will be obtaining a challenging and rewarding role,
         where i can put my skills and learn more and more.

        i have a background working in hospitality and sales. i am trying to change 
        my career into IT industry as i believe it is the future to everything.

        i love travelling and have planned to travel many countries as possible 
        every year with my partner. I feel sometimes travelling can give you a good balance in life.        
        I am also very intrested in cars and bikes, snowbaording and one thing that i like doing at home is 
        reading books which i have recently started doing.
        <br></br>
