    <div text-allign="justified"> <p class="heading1">Having a growth mindset</p>
      <p>Having a growth mindset can change your life. It challanges us to grow. we often toggle between 
        the two ends of the fixed to growth mindset specrtum. Despite where we fall on the spectrum, one 
        thing we each have the power to do is move into a grwth mindset. Training your mindset space can 
        change you life. It helps us to acknowledge and embrace imperfections, viewing challanges as opportunities,
        trying different learning tactics, stop seeking approval, replace the word "failing" with "learning".</p>

    <div text-align="justified"> <p class="heading2">Travelling</p>
      <p>Travelling is what i like doing once a year. Only working can stress out us so travel can be a 
        good thing to put a life to balance. My last travel visit was Bali, a great island with all 
        geographical structures from ocean to tropical forests. They also have a large rice fields, and 
        great for travelling on either budget or luxuriously. It also helps us to build a human connections 
        with one another by learning about culture, food, new sites, music and the way people live thier day to day 
        lives in different parts of the world. Also travelling means freedom, it means finding yourself lost in most 
        amazing ways.</p>

    <div text-align="justified"> <p class="heading3">Workout</p>
      <p>Most of us are well aware of the many health benefits of exercise, but finding the discipline 
        to not only start training but to also stick with it is often the hard part. all it takes is a to
         be consistent with your plans and it will be a good outcome at the end. It also helps us in loosing 
         weight and lower risk of some diseases. It regularly lower a person's risk of developing some diseases, 
         including diabetes, and high blood pressure, heart diseases, quiting smoking, improving mental health and mood.</p>

    <div text-allign="justified"> <p class="heading4">Reading Books</P>
      <p>Somthing is relaxing about grabbing a good book and reading it in a quiet location. you will 
        spend the next couple o fhours lost in a strange new world, and you forget about everything 
        around you and all the stress things happening in your life. i personally have  read 5 books 
        this year and i learned a lot of things, sometime you feel like it is you mentor. it also developes 
        our thoughts, gives us endless knowledge and lessong to read while keeping our minds active. It can 
        help us learn, understand, makes us smarter, keeping brain healthy, reducing stress, making us sleep 
        better and specially setting an example for the kids.</p>

<img class="gallery" src="../img/meditation.jpg" alt="yoga" />
    <div text-allign="justified" <p class="heading5">Meditation</p>
      <p>Meditation is a tough thing to do, we got to have a good patience within us to meditate. 
        Meditation can take you beyond the limitations of the physical body and mind. Only whenyou 
        transcend the limited perspective of the body and mind you have a complete dimension of life 
        within you. i personally like the singing bwol meditation. It helps us to reduce stress, anxiety, promoting 
        emotional health, enchancing self awareness and specially generating kindness. It is said that the exercise 
        helps create new barin cells, the meditation is responsible for keeping them alive and functioning. Together 
        this changes our ability to remain present, calm and focused, which plays a significant role in combating 
        depression and anxiety.</p>
